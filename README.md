 ## Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Python and Power BI
 This project analyzes sentiment patterns in Twitter data to understand public opinion across different topics.
Python was used for data cleaning and preprocessing, while Power BI was used to visualize sentiment distribution and topic-level trends.

# Overview
Social media generates vast amounts of opinionated text. This project applies text preprocessing and sentiment analysis techniques to Twitter data to reveal how people feel about topics or brands. The output includes distributions of sentiment categories and visuals that help interpret trends in public opinion
 
 ## Data Cleaning (Python)
The dataset was cleaned using Python (Pandas) to improve data quality and consistency.

Steps performed:
- Removed rows with missing tweet text
- Labeled tweets by sentiment category
- Cleaned tweet text by:
  - Converting text to lowercase
  - Removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and extra spaces
- Removed duplicate records

 ## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas) for data cleaning
