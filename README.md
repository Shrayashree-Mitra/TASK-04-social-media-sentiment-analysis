Data analysis and insight generation using Python by applying data preprocessing and analytical techniques.

 ##Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Python and Power BI
 This project analyzes sentiment patterns in Twitter data to understand public opinion across different topics.
Python was used for data cleaning and preprocessing, while Power BI was used to visualize sentiment distribution and topic-level trends.
 ## Data Cleaning (Python)
The dataset was cleaned using Python (Pandas) to improve data quality and consistency.

Steps performed:
- Removed rows with missing tweet text
- Standardized sentiment labels
- Cleaned tweet text by:
  - Converting text to lowercase
  - Removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, numbers, punctuation, and extra spaces
- Removed duplicate records
 ## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Regex) for data cleaning
- Power BI for data visualization and analysis
 ## Key Insights
- Negative sentiment is the most dominant across the dataset, indicating a generally critical tone in Twitter discussions.
- Sentiment distribution varies across topics, reflecting differences in public opinion.
- Neutral sentiment appears less frequently compared to positive and negative sentiment.
- A portion of tweets is labeled as irrelevant, highlighting noise in social media data.
